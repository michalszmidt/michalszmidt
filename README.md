Hi, I'm Micha≈Ç Szmidt, computer science student!

Currently learning WebDev backend development mostly with Java, Rust and Go.

I'm Linux user since 13. This made my put it one day on the server and become self-hoster.
Starting with simple DNS adblocker I learned sysadmin stuff including hypervisors like Xen and KVM.
Moving forward I explored containers world with docker, LXD and FreeBSD Jails.
At the same time, I was coding, so I also discovered automated deployment and many many more!

I've been working with many technologies. This was also an important lesson - use a proper tool for the right task.

I learned all this by myself working with documentation and by solving problems with other people.
I would describe my attitude to work as system approach. I get an issue, I code, I solve problems. Next.

Actually I'm looking for job.

I'm happy to answer your questions!
